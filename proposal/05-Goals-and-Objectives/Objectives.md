To implement the first goal there are several objectives, primararily corresponding to the questions that originally provoked the project.
* Measure how often is each ESLR covered.
* Measure the frequency of lessons that incorporate biblical integration.
* Ensure compliance with NESA outcomes.

There are three objectives related to the goal of on-demand visualization. Work towards these objectives will ultimately cause the first set of objectives to be fulfilled.
* Create a simple process to load existing lesson plan documents.
* Enable quick searches across the available data.
* Provide access to visual reports.

The first three objectives can only be achieved after visual reports are available, so first the infrastructure objectives will be pursued, after which the BI objectives will be implemented.
