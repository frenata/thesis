This project aims to analyze and present school lesson plan data, but to what end? The primary goal behind this proposal is a one concerning organizational strategy.  The strategic goal is this: that the school be able to measure how well their teaching matches their educational goals. This is not an unusual organizational goal, since it asks the question: are we doing what we say we will do? 

A fundamental problem identified by Torff for schools that implement standards-education. Administrators can proclaim that the school follows certain standards, books matching those standards can be purchased, and curriculum coordinators can draw up maps specifying how the standards will be met. But none of this guarantees that when it comes to the environment of the classroom that teachers will use and implement these standards.

Verification requires data. While analyzing lesson plans is still a proxy for what _happens_ in the classroom, at least this documentation is being produced by the teachers themselves.

This strategic goal is motivated not only by the desire of Ipeka IICS to ensure their educational goals. It is also driven by the need to verify ongoing improvements to the various accrediting institutions that the school works with. These institutions frequently identify school weaknesses and requiring reporting on efforts to strengthen these weaknesses.
