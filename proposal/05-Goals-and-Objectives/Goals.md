There are two major goals to the present project, one concerning the general purpose of the project, and one concerning the kind of product that is ultimately desired.

First is the strategic goal: that the school be able to measure how well their teaching matches their educational goals. This is not an unusual organizational goal, since it asks the question: are we doing what we say we will do? This was a fundamental problem identified by Torff for schools that implement standards-education.
