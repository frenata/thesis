* discuss need for measuring alignment
* examine current tools

### Carpinelli et al
* Standards are common now (2), and much effort has been spent on developing standards-based curriculum and testing,  but does this translate into standards-based lesson planning?
* Common problems with lesson plans (4)
 * Too many standards/wrong standards
 * Learning objective not related to lesson or standard
 * Assesment is not related to learning objective or standard
* Most techniques to measure effectiveness of lesson plans are related to teacher efficacy (5)
* Authors developed a rubric to evaluate lesson plans (6)
* Gave 200 plans to a panel, but inter-rater reliability was weak. (7)

### Torff
* demand for more teachers has led to alternative teacher certification routes, so how can "competence" be determined?
 * to do this via quantitative means? (test scores)
 * or qualitative (supervisor perception)
* principal evaluations (and of course any eval) is "subjective, potentially biased, and may differ from actual causes"

### Avery
* Program evaluations (of gifted student programs) is limited, and is the data used?
* accountability is only theoretical?
* "absence of data on student learning"
* in interviews with stakeholders, often complaints about lack of data
