### Carpinelli et al
* Standards are common now (2), and much effort has been spent on developing standards-based curriculum and testing,  but does this translate into standards-based lesson planning?
* Common problems with lesson plans (4)
 * Too many standards/wrong standards
 * Learning objective not related to lesson or standard
 * Assesment is not related to learning objective or standard
* Most techniques to measure effectiveness of lesson plans are related to teacher efficacy (5)
* Authors developed a rubric to evaluate lesson plans (6)
* Gave 200 plans to a panel, but inter-rater reliability was weak. (7)
