* history of text analysis/BI
* need for visualization
* examine current visualiation techniques

### Spiro
* text analysis tools can help confirm/deny qualitative analysis 
* very basic tools like Wordle-s are useful, but more powerful tools are desirable to "recognize, extract, and group similar words"
* hard numbers are more trustworthy, but visual _impressions_ can "opened up my eyes so that I could see the stats more meaningfully"
* context matters, not just frequency
* text analysis may not be common in literary (or educational) circles, but it can "inform the kind of arguments critics make"

### Nualart-Vilaplana
* For a single text, visualization can make it easier to pick the right text and understand it.
* We have *more information than we need*, so the presentation of search results is critical to using that information right.
* How to do this well is recognized as important, with top universities offering degrees in the field and many major conferences around the topic.
* Most data is unstructured text.
* text analysis/mining allows for discovery of new information
* people learn better by a "combination of text and illustration" (224)
* "It might prove more effective to apply visualization techniques te texts that have a more formal register and/or predefined outline and a well-defined vocabulary." (232)
* many software approaches that date from 5+ years old are obsolete or unmaintained. Why?
