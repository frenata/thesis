### Spiro
* text analysis tools can help confirm/deny qualitative analysis 
* very basic tools like Wordle-s are useful, but more powerful tools are desirable to "recognize, extract, and group similar words"
* hard numbers are more trustworthy, but visual _impressions_ can "opened up my eyes so that I could see the stats more meaningfully"
* context matters, not just frequency
* text analysis may not be common in literary (or educational) circles, but it can "inform the kind of arguments critics make"
