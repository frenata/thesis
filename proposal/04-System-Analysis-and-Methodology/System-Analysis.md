Presently, teachers build lesson plans by copying and modifying a Google Document template file, which has a variety of fields listed relevant to the goals of data extraction. Lesson plan writing has been standardized in this fashion for the past 1-2 years. Completed plans are uploaded to a departmental shared Google Drive folder, where they can be reviewed by subject coordinators and adminstrators. A single school department is estimated to generate 500-1000 such lesson plans each year.

Both the English and Math departments operate in this manner, albeit with slightly different template files, meaning that the data extraction process will likely need to either flexibly identify correct information or the rules for extraction will need to be modified for each such template. It is unclear at this time to what extent standards-based lesson plans are being produced by other school departments, though it is the desire of administrators that all departments should do so.

After being uploaded to the shared Google Drive, lesson plans are rarely referred to again but are stored. The proposed project intends to draw on these stored lesson plans to do the work of analysis. A key question for implementation is whether the software solution can/should interface directly with Google Drive via the provided APIs or whether it is simpler to interact with documents that are mirrored on a local harddrive.
