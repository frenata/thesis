The present project is being driven by a single developer, the author, so highly structured software enginreering methodologies such as the SDLC were quickly rejected as impractical. The requirements for the final project are also not necessarily well understood, with some stakeholders arguing that what leadership wants may not be what they need. In view of these realities, an Agile approach will be adopted. 

Emphasized in this approach are flexibility, iterative design, and continous stakeholder involvement. It is believed that involvement from relevant stakeholders on a weekly basis is practical, which is critical to project success.

For each development iteration, the following steps will be taken:

1. Gathering user stories with the help of various stakeholders.
2. Analyzing stories and other requirements to come up with proposed architecture.
3. Implementing 1 or more stories and producing a product that the stakeholders can interact with.
4. Validating the implementation of stories with stakeholders.

These four steps will be repeated until all the major elements of the project scope have been implemented.
