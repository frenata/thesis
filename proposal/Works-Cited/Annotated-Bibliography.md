### Spiro
* text analysis tools can help confirm/deny qualitative analysis 
* very basic tools like Wordle-s are useful, but more powerful tools are desirable to "recognize, extract, and group similar words"
* hard numbers are more trustworthy, but visual _impressions_ can "opened up my eyes so that I could see the stats more meaningfully"
* context matters, not just frequency
* text analysis may not be common in literary (or educational) circles, but it can "inform the kind of arguments critics make"

### Nualart-Vilaplana
* For a single text, visualization can make it easier to pick the right text and understand it.
* We have *more information than we need*, so the presentation of search results is critical to using that information right.
* How to do this well is recognized as important, with top universities offering degrees in the field and many major conferences around the topic.
* Most data is unstructured text.
* text analysis/mining allows for discovery of new information
* people learn better by a "combination of text and illustration" (224)
* "It might prove more effective to apply visualization techniques te texts that have a more formal register and/or predefined outline and a well-defined vocabulary." (232)
* many software approaches that date from 5+ years old are obsolete or unmaintained. Why?

* extracting from unstructured text: rule-based or statistical?(924)
 * for semi-structured texts, rule-based seems preferable

### Carpinelli et al
* Standards are common now (2), and much effort has been spent on developing standards-based curriculum and testing,  but does this translate into standards-based lesson planning?
* Common problems with lesson plans (4)
 * Too many standards/wrong standards
 * Learning objective not related to lesson or standard
 * Assesment is not related to learning objective or standard
* Most techniques to measure effectiveness of lesson plans are related to teacher efficacy (5)
* Authors developed a rubric to evaluate lesson plans (6)
* Gave 200 plans to a panel, but inter-rater reliability was weak. (7)

### Torff
* demand for more teachers has led to alternative teacher certification routes, so how can "competence" be determined?
 * to do this via quantitative means? (test scores)
 * or qualitative (supervisor perception)
* principal evaluations (and of course any eval) is "subjective, potentially biased, and may differ from actual causes"

### Avery
* Program evaluations (of gifted student programs) is limited, and is the data used?
* accountability is only theoretical?
* "absence of data on student learning"
* in interviews with stakeholders, often complaints about lack of data
